\usage{
mbPLS.fit(
  X.matrix,
  Y.matrix,
  PLS.comp,
  X.dim,
  center = TRUE,
  scale = TRUE,
  maxiter = 100
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X.matrix}{Predictors matrix. Samples in rows, variables in columns.}

\item{Y.matrix}{Outcome matrix. Samples in rows, this is a matrix with one 
column (continuous variable). The outcome could be imputed survival time. 
For survival time with right-censored survival time and event indicator, the 
right censored time could be imputed by \code{\link{meanimp}}.}

\item{PLS.comp}{Number of PLS components in mbPLS.}

\item{X.dim}{A vector containing the number of predictors in each block 
(ordered).}

\item{center}{A logical value indicating whether mean center should be 
implemented for X.matrix and Y.matrix. The default is TRUE.}

\item{scale}{A logical value indicating whether scale should be 
implemented for X.matrix and Y.matrix. The default is TRUE.}

\item{maxiter}{A integer indicating the maximum number of iteration. The
default number is 100.}
}
\value{
\code{mbPLS.fit} returns a list containing the following components:
\item{X_dim}{A vector containing the number of predictors in each block.}
\item{X_weight}{A list containing the weights of predictors for different 
blocks in different PLS components.}
\item{X_score}{A list containing the scores of samples in different blocks
in different PLS components.}
\item{X_loading}{A list containing the loadings of predictors for different
blocks in different PLS components.}
\item{X_super_weight}{A matrix containing the super weights of different
blocks for different PLS components.}
\item{X_super_score}{A matrix containing the super scores of samples for
different PLS components.}
\item{Y_weight}{A matrix containing the weights of outcome for different 
PLS components.}
\item{Y_score}{A matrix containing the scores of outcome for different 
PLS components.}
\item{X_col_mean}{A matrix containing the mean of each predictor for scaling.}
\item{Y_col_mean}{The mean of outcome matrix for scaling.}
\item{X_col_sd}{A matrix containing the standard deviation of each predictor
for scaling. Predictor with sd = 0 will be set to 1.}
\item{Y_col_sd}{The standard deviation of outcome matrix for scaling.}
\item{center}{A logical value indicating whether mean center is
implemented for X.matrix and Y.matrix.}
\item{scale}{A logical value indicating whether scale is implemented for 
X.matrix and Y.matrix.}

\description{
Function to fit the multi-block partial least square model 
(mbPLS) with several explanatory blocks \eqn{(X_1, ..., X_B)} as our predictors
to explain the outcome Y.
