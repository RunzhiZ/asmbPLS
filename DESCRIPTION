Description: asmbPLS, a supervised algorithm, is an extension of the smbPLS, which allows different quantiles to be used in 
	different blocks of different PLS components to decide the proportion of features to be retained. The best combinations 
	of quantiles can be chosen from a set of user-defined quantiles combinations by cross-validation. By doing this, asmbPLS 
	enables us to do the feature selection for differnt blocks, and the selected features can then be further used to predict 
	the outcome. For example, in biomedical applications, clinical covariates plus different types of omics data such as 
	microbiome, metabolome, mRNA data, methylation data, CNV data might be predictive for patients outcome such as survival time
	or response to therapy. Different types of data could be put in differnt blocks and along with survival time to fit the asmbPLS 
	model. The fitted model can then be used to predict the survival for the new samples with the corresponding clinical covariates 
	and omics data.
